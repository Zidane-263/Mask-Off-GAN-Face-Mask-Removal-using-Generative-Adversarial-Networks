# Mask-Off-GAN-Face-Mask-Removal-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
MaskOff GAN is a project aimed at removing masks from human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project uses TensorFlow and implements a conditional GAN architecture to generate realistic facial images without masks based on input images with masks.
